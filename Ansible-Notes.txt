//Inventory file contains the list of target hosts
//Hosts can be grouped into groups for easier management
//To specify a group, use square brackets [group_name]
//To run ansible commands on a specific group, use the -i option with the inventory file and specify the group name
//Example: ansible webservers -i inventory.ini -m ping
